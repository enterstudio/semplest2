Promising and delivering a â€œhigher level" of care, the Mezzanine Spa is situated in Soho, the skin care hotbed of New York. Situated above the Soho Integrative Health Center, one enters through glass doors, into a calming, Zen-like atmosphere.

Enter on the west side of Crosby Street @ 62, and follow the stairs
leading up to the 2nd floor.

With floors of bamboo, walls of Japanese sea grass, and doors of silver and rice paper, our spa appears to float above the health center. The furnishings and the styling are an extension of the high standard of care in the treatments provided.
Meditation Room

The Mezzanine Medical Day Spa is supported by a staff of medical doctors and licensed estheticians. We offer a full treatment menu of both organic-based services and medically-based services that are results-oriented and sensually pampering. Treatments are uniquely customized and recommended for each client.

Let us put you on the road to perpetual wellness, lasting beauty and improved self-confidence.
