<h2>
    Why We Launched This SEM Company</h2>
<center>
    <p>
        Conceived by a marketer in 2009 with a need to generate traffic to 18,000 local
        retailers, we recognized the need for a tool that eliminates the fear of SEM, 
        frees up resources by automating the process, and eliminates tedious entry requirements 
        by simultaneously launching ad campaigns on Google, Bing and Yahoo! </p>

        <p> Our automated tool dramatically reduces overhead costs associated with data entry, keyword selection & management,
        and bid optimization. </p>
        
         <p>There are no hidden costs, fees or other unwelcomed surprises.
            We deliver results effectively and efficiently.  Let us show you @Html.ActionLink("how", "ContactUs", "Home", new { area = "" }, null).
